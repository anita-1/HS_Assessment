python GET, parse, POST json data

## What I Learned
<br /> 1. It's 2D arrays. Or dictionaries. But mostly 2D arrays. Array? Nah 2D array. 2D arrays everywhere. 
<br /> 2. It takes as long as it takes ok. 
<br /> 3. Really though, it's really cool Python lets you sort an array by the array element array element.
<br /> 4. json.loads(data) turns json data into python dictionary 
<br /> 5. json.dumps(data) turns python data into json
